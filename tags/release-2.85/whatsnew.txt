What's New In OPCAT 2.85 Version
----------------------------------------

				 
NEW - Views, 
		OPCAT navigation left pane was rearranged. 
		The Opd-Things tab was removed and replaced by the Views. There are three Views. The "OPD" 
		view (the old Opd tab), The "OPD-Things" view (the old OPD-Things tab) and a new "Things" view. The
		"Things" view shows all the things in the project arranged alphbetically. 
		New actions on the views - in the OPD-Things view a copy of a Thing to the OPD was added by pressing 
		the right-mouse click on the Thing to be copied. 
		
		Things View - right mouse click on a Thing brings the new Things view menu. In this menu you can Copy, Delete,
		View Thing Instances, In Zoom and Unfold a thing. 
		When View Instances is pressed (or dbl-click on a thing) all instances of the Thing are 
		presented in the tools grid, dbl-click on an instance will show this instance (same as the search mechanism). 
		
NEW - Merge Things in the "Things" View on the left pane,
		Drop a Thing on another Thing will merge the dropped Thing into the target Thing. This is extremely helpful to eliminate
		Things redundancies after importing a diagram.  
	  	There is small BUG here, you can not drag the current node. i.e. when you want to drag a node, first click on a different 
	  	node to make it current and then start dragging the needed node. 		
	  
NEW - New Thing right-click Menu item, "Show Instances". Pressing right click on a Thing will shows all instances of the Thing.
		The results will appear in the Grid.

NEW - Consistency Rule, 
		Adding - adding an instrument or condition link from state to process will check that 
			 the designed system's operation will reach this state during at least one of the operation's scenarios. 
			 if not then a warning is issued.
